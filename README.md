# About EasyFluent
- An externally improved version of fluent, with modifications that can help with the performance of your script-hub.
# EasyFluent Features
- FLAGS LOGIC: Improve performance and facilitate the use of callbacks.
- CALLBACK DEFINITIONS: Avoid the use of tonumber, tostring and more, easy fluent already sets the callback exactly.
- AUTO SAVE CONFIG: saving callback as per user settings, the method is "game.PlaceId" but you can get source in [src](https://github.com/deufyn/EasyFluent/blob/main/src/EasyFluent.luau) and change it.
# EasyFluent Loader
```lua
local EasyFluent = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deufyn/EasyFluent/refs/heads/main/src/EasyFluent.luau'))()
```
- Example of how to use: [Example](https://github.com/deufyn/EasyFluent/blob/main/Example.luau)
# NOTE
- Easyfluent is not completely done, it may have some errors in some situations or something.
